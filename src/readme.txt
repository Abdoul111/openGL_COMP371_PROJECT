this project allows us to visualize a racket in 3D space.

The application handles the following (from assignment 1):

 Pressing the space bar re-position the model at a random location on the grid.

 size up the model by pressing ‘U’ for scale-up and ‘J’ for
scale-down.

 A → move left, D → move right, W → move up, S → move down, Z → rotate left 5 degrees
about Y axis, X → rotate right 5 degrees about Y axis.

 left arrow → Rx, right arrow → R-x, up arrow → Ry, down arrow → R-y. Pressing R button
resets to the initial world position and orientation.

 key ‘P’ for points, key ‘L’ for lines, key ‘T’ for triangles.

o While right button is pressed → use mouse movement in x direction to pan

o While middle button is pressed → use mouse movement in y direction to tilt

o The user can zoom in and out of the scene - while left button is pressed → use mouse
movement to move into/out of the scene.

The application handles the following (New Features):

* we have 4 rackets that initially move together. any translation, rotation, scaling affect all of them.

* However, whenever we click 1, 2, 3, or 4 they become 4 distinct rackets that each has its individual behaviour

*
